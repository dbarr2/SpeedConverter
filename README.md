# Kilometers to Miles Per Hour Converter in Java

This Java application showcases two methods for converting a speed from kilometers per hour (km/h) to miles per hour (mi/h). The first method performs the conversion and returns the value, while the second method prints the conversion result directly, formatted for easy reading.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Java's capability to not only perform mathematical operations and conversions but also to format and present data in a clear, understandable manner. This application is particularly useful for those learning how to handle data conversion, method creation, and output formatting in Java.

## Features

- **Conversion Method**: Converts a speed from km/h to mi/h, returning the result as a double.
- **Formatted Output Method**: Performs the conversion like the first method but prints the result in the format "XX km/h = XX mi/h".

## Conversion Details

The conversion from kilometers per hour to miles per hour is based on the fact that 1 kilometer per hour is approximately equal to 1.609 miles per hour.

## Usage

1. **Conversion Method**: Call this method when you need the conversion result as a value in your code.
2. **Formatted Output Method**: Use this method when you want to display the conversion directly to the user in a formatted manner.
